##### SUMMARY:
As a Senior Engineer on the AWS Identity & Access Management team, I spearheaded the re-architecture of its core monolithic service, a foundational platform with over 300 APIs. This strategic initiative involved decomposing the monolith into a scalable, distributed microservices architecture. The primary goals were to improve API performance, enhance system resilience, and increase developer productivity by enabling clear ownership segregation of components. I collaborated with multiple teams to define and build the next generation of the service, focusing on simplifying the developer experience.
