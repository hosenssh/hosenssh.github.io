description: "Migrating a Distributed E-commerce Backend to a Modern Orchestration Platform."

##### SUMMARY:
As a Staff Software Engineer at Coupang, I led a major architectural initiative to migrate the core e-commerce backend from a brittle, message-driven system to a modern, durable orchestration platform. The legacy system consisted of numerous services with mixed naming conventions and redundant APIs running in Kubernetes pods. These services used Kafka as a pseudo-orchestration layer, which made tracking the end-to-end lifecycle of an order incredibly difficult and prone to failure. My role was to design and execute a migration strategy that would increase system reliability, provide clear observability into business workflows, and allow for a safe, incremental transition.
