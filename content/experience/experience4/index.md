##### SUMMARY:
As a Software Development Engineer at the AWS Billing orgranization, I led a brand new team of four to architect and build a business-critical, automated billing platform from the ground up for the VMwareCloudOnAWS service. This system was responsible for the entire financial workflow, including pricing, subscriptions, revenue reporting, and partner invoicing. I designed a highly scalable serverless architecture centered on a suite of generic, API-first principles. This allowed for the flexible modeling of complex pricing plans and subscription lifecycles to support a wide array of financial scenarios.
