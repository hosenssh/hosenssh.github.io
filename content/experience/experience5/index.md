##### SUMMARY:
During my time with AWS Metering & Usage, I engineered and led the development of critical data infrastructure responsible for processing massive volumes of cloud usage data. I designed and implemented a high-throughput asynchronous API service that handled thousands of partitions and over 4 billion records per hour, providing a crucial data backbone for usage aggregation and cost analysis. I also reinvented a legacy streaming data processing system using Apache Spark, which resulted in a 40% reduction in latency and established 100% audit-ability, vital for financial data integrity. Additionally, I built a resilient control plane system with a self-service portal for managing over 500 distributed data ingestion hosts.
